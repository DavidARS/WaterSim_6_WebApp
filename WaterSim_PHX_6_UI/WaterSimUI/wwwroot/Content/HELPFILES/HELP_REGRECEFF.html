<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #4F5557;">

<b>Definition:</b> The percent of total wastewater from residential, commercial, and industrial water users that is diverted to a reclaimed wastewater treatment plant (Water Reclamation Facility) for treatment to a level that is appropriate for human uses, including human consumption. Other water is sent to a traditional wastewater treatment plant and treated for non-human uses.
<br><br>
<b>Real World Example:</b> Treated wastewater from a Water Reclamation Facility may be used by cities to bolster their water supplies. This can include recharge into the aquifer using infiltration basins, or generally yet unused methodologies/technologies such as direct injection recharge and reverse osmosis water treatment plants, which return potable water to the water provider (cities) to be used as part of their water supply. Some of the reclaimed water is invariably discharged into washes and streams.
<br><br>
<b>Implementation:</b> This control determines the percentage, from 0 to 100%, of wastewater that is diverted to the reclaimed wastewater treatment plant for treatment to standards suitable for human uses, with 100% representing all available wastewater being diverted to the Water Reclamation Facility for reuse by the cities.
