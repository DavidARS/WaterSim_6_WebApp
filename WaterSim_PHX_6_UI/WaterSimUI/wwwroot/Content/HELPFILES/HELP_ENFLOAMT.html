<h3 style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #990033;">Environment Flows</h3>

<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #4F5557;">
<b>Definition:</b> Environmental flows indicate the number of acre-feet of Colorado River water designated in the simulation to sustaining the Colorado River Delta.

<br><br>

<b>Real World Example:</b> 
Riparian (riverbank) habitats require a certain amount of water flow to sustain the plants and animals that live and thrive there. The amount of water needed greatly depends on the time of year, and the particular plants and animals living in the riverine ecosystem. A 2012 binational agreement determined that 158,088 acre-feet of water over a five year period (modeled annually here) are needed to restore the Colorado River Delta.
<br><br>

<b>Implementation:</b>
This control determines Arizona’s share, from 0 to 158,088 acre-feet, being delivered by the simulation. Because Arizona’s proportion of the total flow stays constant in this model, this also controls the amount of committed flows satisfied by the entire Colorado River Basin. A full commitment designates what is needed to the Delta, but reduces the amount of water available for municipal, commercial, and industrial uses; committing 0 acre-feet intentionally leaves no water for the Delta. Note that in low flow years, a high percentage of environmental commitment may be impossible to achieve.
