 	<b>The Population Sustainability Indicator</b> measures the number of years following the simulation that the water supply can support the current population before they would experience water deficits or have to find additional water supplies at higher costs. Simply put, this indicator represents the number of years of water supply the last house built in 2050 has before it runs out of water (from current water sources). Factors influencing this indicator are consumption (GPCD) and population size.
Based on the comprehensive Groundwater Management Act of 1980, municipal water providers within an active management area must demonstrate an “adequate water supply,” meaning physical or legal access to a 100-year supply of water.
