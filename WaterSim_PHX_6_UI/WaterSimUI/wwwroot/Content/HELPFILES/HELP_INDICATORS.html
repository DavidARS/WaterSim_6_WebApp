<p style="font-family: Arial,'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica,  sans-serif; color: #4F5557;">
The sustainability of community water systems may be evaluated using "indicators"; the five indicators presented here represent the state of community values toward water supply and use. Each indicator represents a different aspect of water sustainability, but what is considered sustainable may vary from person to person. For example farmers may consider maximizing their access to water as essential for creating a sustainable food supply, but a manufacturer may consider maximizing their access to water as essential for a sustainable economy. 
<p style="font-family: Arial,'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica,  sans-serif; color: #4F5557;">Sustainable food supplies and economy are both important to a community's over all sustainability. Seeking an acceptable level of water system sustainability requires tradeoffs among these values.
These indicators of sustainability are linked to the policy levers. 
<p style="font-family: Arial,'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica,  sans-serif; color: #4F5557;">Each policy lever will have a different impact on the indicators. The trade-offs between communities values as represented by the indicators will be based on the policy choices chosen. There is no one clear "right" answer, rather each person or group will use the policy choices to seek what they consider to be an acceptable balance among the indicators based on their own community values.
 <p style="font-family: Arial,'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica,  sans-serif; color: #4F5557;">The value presented represents the final value (end of 2050) over the simulation period. The values for each indicator from the previous simulation are retained at the bottom of each indicator (parenthetically). Note "..." is displayed when there is no previous value available or when representing the value of zero.
