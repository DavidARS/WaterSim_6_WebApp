<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #4F5557;">

The user can set a predefined climate effect on river flows for the Colorado River and the Salt-Verde Rvers; the current controls are defined as: 1) Flood, 2) No Effect, 2) Slight, 3) Moderate, and 4) Severe.
<br><br>
<b>Definitions:</b> <br><br>
Flood: Increased flows on all rivers by 20% above historical (120% of historical, for the river trace used).<br> <br>
No Effect: No reduction in river flows.<br> <br>
Slight: Flows are reduced by 11% on the Colorado River and 20% on the Salt-Verde Rivers, <br> <br>
Moderate: Flows on the Colorado River are reduced by 30% while flows on the Salt-Verde Rivers are reduced by 35%. <br><br>
Severe: Flows on the Colorado river are reduced by 40% while flows on the Salt-Verde Rivers are reduced by 45%. This setting mimics the RCP 8.5 emission pathway.
<br><br>
NOTE: The river "trace" (the 30-year segment from the historical flow-gauge-record) changes with the predefined settings; we use a low flow record for the Moderate and
Severe choices and the Median flow record for the Slight setting.
