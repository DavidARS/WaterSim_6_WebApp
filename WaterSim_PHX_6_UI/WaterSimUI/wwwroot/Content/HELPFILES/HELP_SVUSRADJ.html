<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #4F5557;">
The Salt-Verde Drought Adjustment Percent modifies the simulated flow on the Salt and Verde Rivers above the reservoirs, due to the effect of drought on runoff.
<br><br>
This control varies from 0 to 100%, with 100% equal to the historical estimate of river flow, with no effect of drought. Values less than 100% decrease the flows by the percentage chosen and for the period of time chosen by altering the start and stop year of the drought.
<br><br>
Please note: You must enter a start year and stop year for the simulated drought. The start year cannot be earlier than the present year and the end year must be after the start year, but not later than 2050.
