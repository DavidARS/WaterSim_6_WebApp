<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #4F5557;">
<b>Definition:</b>The percent of available reclaimed water to be used for outdoor irrigation. <br><br>

<b>Real World Example:</b>
Many Cities treat waste water (effluent) to a higher standard such that this treated water may be used for alternative purposes, such as golf course irrigation or even backyard irrigation.
<br><br>

<b>Implementation:</b>
Simply choose an amount of available reclaimed water to use for outdoor irrigation. 100% means that all available reclaimed water is used to irrigate outdoor landscapes. NOTE: for this control to be effective the user
must ensure that there is reclaimed waste water available to use. Water must be diverted from the waste water teatment plant to the reclaimed plant. For our purposes this may be accomplished by using the button policy control immediately above this control labeled "Wastewater Reclaimed."
