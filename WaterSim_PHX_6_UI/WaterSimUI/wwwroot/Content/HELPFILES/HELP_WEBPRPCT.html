<h3 style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #990033;">Forecasted Per Capita Water Use</h3>

<p style="font-family:  'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #4F5557;">
<b>Definition:</b> The per capita water use controls the forecasted percentage of the amount of water used on a personal (per capita) basis measured in gallons per capita per day (GPCD). This value alters the total GPCD for your city, and the region, and includes residential, commercial, and, in many cases, industrial water use divided among the population.

<br><br>
<b>Real World Example:</b>
There are many ways to reduce our personal water consumption such as installing low-flow toilets and low-flow shower heads; installing water efficient household appliances, such as new dishwashers and clothes washers; and reducing water use outdoors by removing turf grass and/or converting to landscapes with low water use plants with automated irrigation controllers that manage watering schedules efficiently.
<br><br>
In 2010, the mean water consumption for the Phoenix Metropolitan Area was 320 GPCD, with a median GPCD of 225. This indicates that there is a broad disparity in the community and household water use across the Valley.

<br><br>

<b>Implementation:</b>
This control reflects the implementation of water policies that reduce personal water consumption and contribute to a lowered GPCD for the entire city or region. This control varies from 0 to 100%, with 0% equal to a minimum GPCD (currently set at 70 GPCD; maximum reduction) and 100% equal to the forecasted GPCD for 2085.
