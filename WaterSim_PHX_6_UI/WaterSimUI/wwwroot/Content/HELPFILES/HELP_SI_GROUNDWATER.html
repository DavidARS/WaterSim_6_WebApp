<b>The Groundwater Sustainability Indicator </b> 
demonstrates the percentage of the total water portfolio that must be satisfied through groundwater pumping.  For some communities, including many Indian communities, agriculture entities, and municipal water providers, groundwater is their only source of water. But for communities with access to surface water supplies, groundwater can act as a buffer, providing a reserve supply when other supplies are scarce. Pumping less groundwater now leaves more groundwater available for future use during drought or emergencies when surface water supplies are reduced. Thus, decreasing the amount of groundwater pumped increases the sustainability of the water supply.
