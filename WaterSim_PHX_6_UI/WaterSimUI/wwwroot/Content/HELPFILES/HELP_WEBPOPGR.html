<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #4F5557;">
<b>Definition:</b> The Forecasted Population Growth Rate controls the change in the forecasted population of the region.

<br><br>
<b>Real World Example:</b> 
The population of the Phoenix Metropolitan Area has been steadily increasing, especially since World War II. The population of the City of Phoenix has grown by 23 percent just since the year 2000. Greater rates of population growth (at a constant GPCD) increase water consumption. Reduced rates of population growth help reduce anticipated consumption needs. The WaterSim model uses population growth projections from one of two governmental authorities, the Department of Economic Security (DES) or the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG).
<br><br>
<b>Implementation:</b>
This control varies from 0 to 150%, with 100% equal to the default projection provided by DES or MAG. Values greater than 100% increase the forecasted population growth rate beyond the default projection, while values less than 100% decrease the forecasted population growth rate from the projected value.
<br><br>
For example: A value of 130% will increase the projected population growth rate for the region by 30% above the default, i.e., forecasted, estimate. A value of 80% will decrease the forecasted estimate by 20%.
