<b>The Agriculture Sustainability Indicator</b> is a measure of the percentage of agriculture water credits being diverted from agricultural use on farms to municipal water use for the region as a whole. Presently, agriculture account for almost 50% of the total water use in Maricopa County and this vital economic engine remains a cultural identity for many communities and families. Even so, in the future, water currently used for farming and agriculture may instead be used to help meet the water needs of growing communities. However, reductions in Colorado River deliveries, as a result of drought or climate change, could reduce the number of water credits available for transfer from agriculture to municipal use.
For this simulation, the percentage of surface and groundwater diverted from farms and agriculture to municipal water use ranges from 0 to 100%, with 100% representing all available water being diverted and no water available for agriculture. However, the transfer of water credits would be phased in gradually and complete transfer would not be accomplished until 2085.
