<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #4F5557;"><b>The Environment Sustainability Indicator</b> reports the percentage of the amount of Colorado River water estimated as necessary to sustain the Colorado River Delta that is being met by the simulation. A 2012 binational agreement for the Colorado River Basin committed 158,088 acre-feet of water over a five year period (modeled annually here) to restoring the Delta. 
<br><br>
Arizona is responsible for a proportion of this water and the indicator will reflect the percentage of Arizona’s commitment to environmental flows for the Delta that is being met. However, in low flow years, there may not be enough water left over for the environment after satisfying municipal and agricultural needs. Because Arizona’s proportion of the total flow stays constant in this model, the indicator also shows the percentage of committed flows satisfied by the entire Colorado River Basin.
