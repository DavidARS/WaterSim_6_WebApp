River flows have long historical records. In WaterSim we use a 30-year segment from the historical record which we refer to as a "trace." If the simulation runs longer than 30 years, the trace segment chosen is repeated. The accompanying graph (immediately below) illustrates the annual river flows for the two riverine systems (and the median value for the trace; dashed line).
<br><br>
In this User Interface we expose four specific traces: we enable the user to select a 30-year segment that represent: A) low flow years, B) median flow years, C) high flow years, and 4) years of high inter-annual variabilityâ€”with some low flow and some high flow years. Each trace used will create different model results.
