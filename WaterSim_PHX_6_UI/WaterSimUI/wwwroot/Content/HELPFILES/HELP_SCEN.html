<h3 style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #990033;">The Specific Scenario Used</h3>

<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #4F5557;">
<b>Definition:</b>One of Seven Scenarios available for simulation. <br><br>

<b>Real World Example:</b> <br>
<b><font size="4">Flood:</font></b> <br>
The <q>Desert Wetland</q> scenario is envisioned as a future designed to be resilient to extreme flooding events. This is accomplished by revitalizing (and re-envisioning) the region's river system primarily through the extensive softening of traditional hard flood infrastructure. In this scenario urban density will not change drastically (from the Strategic vision), however impervious surfaces city-wide are reduced significantly. During high rainfall events, the scenario is designed to allow surface water to move through a regional floodplain network. In addition, an expansive green network parallels the freeways to absorb the most extreme flooding events. Additional pervious areas and retention basins are also placed along the Light Rail corridor and are considered  part of the green network during flood events. An iconic feature of this scenario are neighborhood-scale, ephemeral wetlands and linear parks irrigated using household gray water in dry times and storm water during precipitation events (although stormwater effects are not addressed in this contribution). Rather than directly banking water for future water security, this scenario emphasizes on-site use to support green infrastructure. Overall, by 2060 canopy cover will be 25%, primarily dispersed in residential areas with a focus on native plants and some edible landscapes. Peri-urban agriculture remains mostly untouched in this future scenario.
<br><br>
<b><font size="4">Heat:</font></b> <br>
Through massive and strategic increases in shade and canopy cover, the <q>Cool it or Lose it</q> scenario strives to reduce local heat exposure specifically in neighborhoods with high social vulnerability. Overall, the canopy cover is 50% (25% desert adapted trees and 25% gray shade). Half of parking lots and transit stations are shaded with a mix of green and gray shade. Canals are primary transportation and energy corridors. The light rail serves as a <q>connector spine</q> to the open space park network, which has increased significantly. Impervious surfaces are covered or reduced along transit corridors (light rail and canal). Sprawl development has decreased and unnecessary pavement has been replaced with other, less heat retaining materials. Agriculture has been redistributed on a smaller scale throughout the urban environment.
<br><br>

<b><font size="4">Drought:</font></b> <br>
The <q>True Cost of Water</q> scenario emphasizes <q>desert living.</q> Iconic features of this future include aggressive water conservation targets, high priority on long-term water security through banking, and centralized stormwater and water reuse infrastructure. All landscaping, except in parks, is xeric or native, much of it watered by household greywater. Overall there is a decreased focus on agriculture in this future, but some still exists on the periphery of the city. The remaining agriculture is returned to native Sonoran Desert. Water efficient and drought resistant small-scale urban farms help supply food. High water prices have encouraged higher density residential development in previously suburbanized places. While light rail has expanded, people still rely on their personal vehicles.
<br><br>
<b><font size="4">Almost Zero Waste:</font></b><br>
The central theme of the <q>Almost Zero Waste</q> scenario was is self-sufficiency and minimal waste. This is achieved through aggressive targets for water conservation, capture, reuse, and recycling. Residents of this water future live within twenty minutes of 80&#45;90% of their needs in higher densities and mixed-use development. Urban density in the <q>Almost Zero Waste</q> scenario is concentrated in designated urban cores and along public transportation corridors. Urban gardens and vegetation are nourished by neighborhood composting and are watered by residential graywater administered through a <q>smart</q> irrigation system. By 2060, this scenario uses 100% reclaimed water for outdoor irrigation. While there is a strong emphasis on local&#45;scale, decentralized solutions for material, water, and energy recycling and reuse, this scenario also features large-scale centralized stormwater infrastructure to accommodate water banking for future use.
<br><br>
<b><font size="4">Healthy Harvest Hubs:</font></b> <br>
The <q>Healthy Harvest Hubs</q> scenario is organized around agricultural and urban hubs to optimize city function. In the agricultural hubs along the rivers, crops are highly water efficient. These ag hubs support food production for the regional population and are connected to the urban core by light rail, which replaced the existing freeway system (no personal cars in this future). The Tempe and Mesa area hubs are characterized as middle density "garden hubs" containing single and multi&#45;family housing with small scale gardens dispersed throughout (e.g., 1 garden per 5&#45;10 residences). The Phoenix area hub features dense development with high rise apartments and an economy unrelated to agriculture. There is little open space within the boundaries of the Phoenix hub but open space is accessible via rails or trails on the periphery of the urban cores. Overall urban extent has greatly reduced with much of it being converted to native desert, new agriculture, and solar and wind energy production hubs.
<br><br>
<b><font size="4">Emerald City:</font></b><br>
Unique to the <q>Emerald City</q> scenario is the creative and strategic land use and urban form to address flood, drought, and heat risks. Decentralization of rain, storm, and gray water infrastructure for on-site use allows for local greening alleviating the pressure on potable water sources for outdoor irrigation. Another iconic feature of this scenario is the repurposing of existing freeways (75% of 2015 freeways) into greenways. Supplemented by the existing canal system, the new greenways support a multi-modal transportation network. Open spaces are accessible via this emerald necklace network. Growth boundaries are the same as today but enforced, which has encouraged inward and vertical development concentrated at intersections of the multi-modal transportation network (i.e. canals and repurposed freeways). Buildings are designed to support vegetation, provide shade, and other cooling opportunities. Vegetation&#45;overall canopy cover 25%&#45;is heavily concentrated in the emerald network system. There is roughly the same amount of agriculture in this future but instead of occupying the periphery of the urban environment, it is embedded within it.
<br><br>
<b><font size="4">Strategic:</font></b><br>
The Strategic Scenario was developed to reflect a plausible future for the Phoenix metro region based on existing municipal planning goals and policies. In this scenario, transportation will largely be business-as-usual with some increased emphasis on light rail and promoting more walkable communities through tree&#45;lined and shaded pathways. Land use will also largely be business-as-usual with small additions to green mesic parks and desert open space in the urban area, the remaining public landscape is primarily xeric or drought-resistant. Most of the new urbanization occurs on peri-urban agriculture and some on desert open space, however existing desert preserves will be maintained as growth boundary and some peri-urban agriculture will still exist. This scenario projects an increase in high density housing and a decrease in medium density households by the year 2060. Low density housing is projected to remain high but without significant increase or decrease. While the overall urban extent will generally increase, there is a significant emphasis on infill of vacant lots to promote more compact neighborhoods, which results in an overall higher density city.
